      <abstract>
        <p>We describe a small hylid frog species with a highly distinctive tadpole from the Kimberley region of northern Western Australia. The new taxon is morphologically very similar to Litoria meiriana but can be differentiated using a combination of adult and larval morphology and male calls. Tadpoles of the new taxon can be readily differentiated from those of L. meiriana by their unique black, gold and red pigment patterns and the continuous papillary border around the oral disc. Advertisement calls of L. aurifera sp. nov. are longer, have more pulses, have more marked frequency modulation and are produced at a lower rate than those of L. meiriana. Litoria aurifera sp. nov. is only known from locations up to about 100 km south of the Prince Regent River and is associated with small creeks on massive sandstone escarpments, while L. meiriana is widespread in escarpments across northern Western Australia and the northern part of the Northern Territory.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The Kimberley region of northern Western Australia is the westernmost part of the Australian Monsoon
Tropics which span the top of Australia, and receives more than 85% of annual rainfall between November
and April (Bowman et al. 2010). Inland from the coast, this region is characterised by large sandstone
escarpments dissected by rivers which form habitat islands in a ‘savanna sea’ of tall grasses, spinifex and
eucalypt woodland (Bowman et al. 2010). The remote, rugged escarpments within the Kimberley are difficult
to access during the monsoon period, hence the amphibian fauna has remained largely unexplored in all but a
few areas. Recent field studies focusing on this region have resulted in the description of three new frog
species (Doughty &amp; Anstis 2007; Doughty &amp; Roberts 2008; Doughty et al. 2009) and highlight the potential
for further undescribed species in the Kimberley. While discoveries of these three species reflect more
intensive field work in remote locations, the recent discovery of a new species in an area previously well
surveyed close to the major city of Darwin (Young et al. 2005), indicates that the frog diversity in the
Australian Monsoon Tropics is not completely known.</p>
      <p>On a botanical expedition in early January 1995, Matt and Russell Barrett observed some very unusual,
brightly-coloured tadpoles immediately south of the Prince Regent River Nature Reserve. All locations were
within about 40 km of the Prince Regent River in creeks on massive sandstone. Collections of the tadpoles by
the Barrett brothers were made in 2001 and 2003, with the specimens forwarded to MJT, who recognised them
to be an undescribed species but none was successfully raised to adulthood in captivity. Subsequent
examination of these preserved tadpoles by MA indicated a likely affinity with the larvae of Litoria meiriana
in size, shape and some features of the oral disc.</p>
      <p>An expedition was undertaken in January 2007 to observe and collect tadpoles and adults of the new
species. Tadpoles and adults were collected, with some live tadpoles brought back to Kununurra for captive
rearing. Call recordings of adult males were also made. The new taxon was observed to be very similar to
Litoria meiriana, a small, distinctive species associated with rock holes and flowing creeks from the
Kimberley to Arnhem Land (Tyler 1969), and both species share the unique ability to ‘bounce’ lightly across
the water surface without immersion. Here we compare adults, call structures and tadpoles of the two species
and provide a description of the new taxon.
We examined specimens (listed in the Appendix) held in the collections of the Western Australian Museum,
Perth (WAM) and South Australian Museum, Adelaide (SAMA). Four of the tadpoles of the new taxon
collected in 2007 were reared from tadpoles to adulthood in captivity.</p>
      <p>Adult morphology. Methods and abbreviations of morphometric measurements (Table 1) follow Tyler
(1968). We tested for a difference in SVL with a one-way ANOVA. TL, HW and HL were tested with
oneway ANCOVAs, with SVL as a covariate; the covariate was deleted if not signifcant at the P = 0.05 level. All
specimens were fixed in 10% formalin, and then preserved in 70% ethanol. Measurements were made with
the aid of an ocular micrometer attached to a stereoscopic microscope, or with digital callipers to the nearest
0.01 mm. Colours of the adults were compared with the Pantone swatches.</p>
      <p>Tadpoles. Preserved tadpoles of L. meiriana were described briefly by Tyler et al. (1983) from the
Magela Creek system in the Northern Territory. For more detailed comparison between species here, further
live and preserved samples were collected from Kakadu National Park, Northern Territory and Kununurra in
north-eastern Western Australia.</p>
      <p>Tadpoles of the new taxon were raised in 40 cm diameter opaque plastic containers in water to a depth of
15 cm over a substrate of sandy gravel and rocks. They were fed small amounts of crushed algae discs. Water
was aerated using an airstone attached to a pump. Temperature was not controlled, but ranged between about
27–35°C when tadpoles were reared at Kununurra, Western Australia immediately after field collection,
where January maximum temperatures are similar to those at the collection sites.</p>
      <p>Prior to study, selected tadpoles were anaesthetised in a solution of 0.2% chlorbutol, then photographed
with a Nikon D80 and 60 mm macro lens. Measurements of anaesthetised specimens were obtained with the
aid of vernier calipers and a micrometer eye-piece attached to a Wild M5 stereoscopic microscope. Voucher
specimens were preserved in 4% buffered formalin (Tyler 1962) and in 70% ethanol, later to be deposited in
the WAM and SAMA. Drawings of preserved specimens were prepared with the aid of a drawing tube
attached to the microscope. Tadpoles were staged according to Gosner (1960). Methods of measurement and
abbreviations of morphometric measurements of tadpoles (Tables 4, 5) follow Anstis and Tyler (2005) and
Anstis (2002).</p>
      <p>Call analysis. The calls of five L. aurifera sp. nov. from a creek off Bachsten Creek in Prince Regent
River Nature Reserve and five L. meiriana males from 'The Grotto', 28.2 km south-east of Wyndham, Western
Australia were analysed. Calls can be heard on the Alcoa Frog Watch website (see References). Calls were
recorded on a Marantz PMD660, digital recorder using a Beyer M88 microphone and recorded as WAV files
sampled at 48 kHz. Calls were analysed using Raven 1.3. Frequency was analysed using default settings of:
Hann window, DFT size of 256 samples and grid spacing of 188 Hz with no spectral averaging. We
determined peak frequency values in a spectrum display made from selected portions of the call in the
waveform display or frequency range in a spectrogram display. For both species we defined the advertisement
call as the commonest calls produced in consistent bouts.</p>
      <p>For both species we recorded air temperature at sites where frogs were calling on sloping rock surfaces
along small, rapidly flowing streams, generally in the splash zone. This is a compromise measure, as actual
body temperature will be influenced by rock and ambient air temperatures and evaporation, both from rocks
splashed by water flow and the frog’s skin.</p>

      <title>Systematics</title>
      <p>Although the traditional characters of adult morphology do not unambiguously diagnose Litoria meiriana and
the new taxon, when taken together with the evidence from tadpole morphology and male calls, we propose
there are two species involved in our comparisons. The new taxon appears to be confined to the region of the
Prince Regent River Nature Reserve and up to about 60 km further south of it. Based on a consensus of adult
and larval morphology and acoustic characters, we describe the populations from the high rainfall zone of the
western Kimberley as a new species, Litoria aurifera sp. nov.
Holotype: WAM R169913, an adult female collected as a tadpole from a creek near Bachsten Creek, Prince
Regent River Nature Reserve, Western Australia (elevation 343m; 15º59’18.2”S, 125º19’38.1”E) on 23
January 2007 by J.D. Roberts and P. Doughty and raised to an adult by M. Anstis.</p>
      <p>Paratypes (prefixes excluded). Paratypes include a mix of field-collected adults, males with recorded
calls, and two adults reared from tadpoles. WAM specimens are all taken from smaller unnamed creeks off
Bachsten Creek, Prince Regent River Nature Reserve.</p>

168016–8 (males): elevation 349m, 15°59'22"S, 125°19'36"E; 168059 (male), 168062 (male): elevation
260m, 15°44'54"S, 125°22'25"E; 168095 (male): elevation 232m, 15°25'42"S, 125°18'42"E; 168114 (male),

168182–5 (males): elevation 408m, 15°51'34"S, 125°41'47"E.</p>
      <p>SAMA specimens were reared from tadpoles collected at 5.1 km ESE of junction of Pitta Creek and
Prince Regent River, Western Australia: 63001 and 63002 (male and female): elevation 408m, 15º51’34.6”S,
125º41’47”E.</p>
      <p>Diagnosis. Australia has three hylid genera of which Cyclorana is fossorial, Nyctimystes has a vertical
pupil and palpebral venation, and Litoria, which has a horizontal pupil and no palpebral venation. The new
taxon is assigned to Litoria because of its obvious morphological affinity to Litoria meiriana in body form,
size, skin colour and texture and its ability to bounce lightly across the water surface without immersion, an
attribute shared only by L. meiriana.</p>
      <p>Litoria aurifera is a small (to 22 mm), saxicoline species, characterized by a somewhat dorsoventrally
compressed, slight body and numerous scattered tubercles over the dorsal surface. The snout is moderately
pointed in dorsal view, canthus rostralis slightly curved, tympanum distinct and toes almost fully webbed. It
can be distinguished from L. meiriana primarily by its vividly pigmented gold and black tadpole and by adult
call characteristics.</p>
      <p>While very similar to L. meiriana, the snout of adult L. aurifera tends to be slightly more pointed in dorsal
view (Figure 1C), and SVL, TL and HW are slightly greater than the former species.</p>
      <p>Description of holotype. Size small (SVL 21.8 mm). Head slightly longer (7.7 cm) than broad (6.4 cm),
HL/HW 1.203. Canthus rostralis very slightly curved. Snout moderately pointed when viewed from above;
obtusely rounded in profile. Eye prominent, horizontal diameter 2.7 mm. Eye to naris distance greater than
internarial span (EN/IN 1.7). Tympanum distinct with sharply defined annulus; horizontal diameter 2.0 mm.
Small circular gland at angle of jaws and poorly developed supratympanic fold. Vomerine teeth oblique, slope
slightly downwards towards medial corner.

aurifera sp. nov. (WAM R169913, female) and hand and foot of holotype of Litoria aurifera (WAM R169913, female).
A, B = holotype of L. meiriana dorsal and lateral views; C, D = holotype of L. aurifera dorsal and lateral views; E, F =
hand and foot of L. aurifera. Bar represents 5 mm.</p>
      <p>Fingers long and slender, in decreasing order of length 3&gt;4&gt;2&gt;1, with small, transversely oval terminal
discs that are distinctly wider than digits; a trace of webbing between third and fourth fingers. Subarticular
tubercle at base of terminal phalanx elongate and oval. Palmar tubercle broad and flattened (Figure 1E). Tibia
length slightly more than one-half SVL (TL/SVL 0.55). Toes long and slender, in decreasing order of length
4&gt;5&gt;3&gt;2&gt;1, discs slightly more rounded than oval and wider than digits. Interdigital webbing extensive,
reaching the base of the discs of all digits except the third and fourth (Figure 1F). Inner metatarsal tubercle
small and elongate; outer metatarsal tubercle extremely small and circular. The dorsum bears numerous
scattered slightly raised tubercles, middorsal tubercles more flattened. The throat is smooth; abdomen is
weakly granular with granulation larger towards sides of body.</p>
      <p>The colour in life of the dorsal surface and limbs is mottled with shades of brown and reddish brown
(Pantone 464M to 465M). Dorsal tubercles are surrounded by darker brown (462M), which is also in patches
upon the hind limbs. The upper lip is often edged with dark brown and silver-white bars, and the sides of the
body have scattered whitish tubercles on a dark brown background. The iris is reddish above and grey-gold
below (Figure 2C). In ventral view, the submandibular area and throat are warm grey (1M), and the abdomen
is white tinged with pale copper-pink (Figure 2E). The undersurface of the limbs is dark flesh colour (436M).
In preservative, each of the pigments is paler and all red, gold and copper pigment is lost.</p>
      <p>Variation. Males (N = 20) range in SVL from 18.2–20.2 mm and females (N = 8) from 20.3–21.6 mm.
The TL/SVL range is 0.479 to 0.594 (Table 1). The nasal and maxillary bones are extremely thin and the
anterior portion of the skull is therefore subject to distortion by compression. As a result, some specimens
were excluded from the analysis because they are slightly distorted rendering measurements unreliable.

fast flowing creeks which collect water from rain on sandstone rock escarpments. Tadpoles were collected
from pools within the creeks, but were never found in larger creeks or water that carries silt from flooding (M.
Barrett, pers. comm.). Water depth in the pools ranged from a few cm to 1 m and substrate was irregular
sandstone rock. In some sites the yellow sandstone rock was covered with patches of black algae, on which
tadpoles were well camouflaged.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="3">
      <title>Tadpole morphology and development</title>
      <p>Ovarian eggs. Ovarian eggs are very small and pigmented: the animal pole is dark brown and the vegetal pole
is white. The total ova in three preserved females is 60, 61 and 111. The mean diameter of 11 ova that appear
fully formed is 0.9 mm (0.8–1.0). Although not observed in life, eggs and embryos are likely to be very
similar to those of L. meiriana, which are laid in small clusters attached to submerged rock (Davies et al.
1983). They have a brown animal pole and white vegetal pole with a diameter in life of about 1 mm prior to
stage 10 (Anstis, unpublished).</p>
      <p>Tadpoles. Tadpoles are unique in their remarkable pigmentation, and this alone makes them readily
distinguishable from all other known Australian tadpoles. A composite description of tadpoles at stages 25–39
is provided, with developmental changes in later stages 40–46 (up to metamorphosis). Measurements of total
length and body length compared to L. meiriana are provided in Table 5 and illustrations of the tadpole of L.
meiriana are included for further comparison (Figures 4A, B; 5A; 6A and 7A). The largest tadpole of L.
aurifera had a total length of 29.0 mm and body length of 10.5 mm (stage 39).</p>
      <p>Body: Body small, streamlined and wider than deep (often slightly wider across gill region). Snout
rounded (stage 26) to broadly rounded in dorsal view by stage 36, elongate and rounded in lateral view
(Figures 4C, D). Eyes dorsolateral with slight anterior tilt, somewhat disguised from view in life due to dorsal
body pigmentation. Iris dense black with dull copper-gold iridophores mainly above and below pupil. Nares
small (e.g. 0.2 mm, stage 36), moderately spaced, open anterolaterally with a dorsal tilt; rim slightly raised on
inner edge. Spiracle sinistral, fairly short, tapers slightly to its posterodorsal opening, and is positioned well
below the horizontal body axis, posterior to midpoint of body. In preserved specimens, the spiracle may
appear contracted slightly further up the side of the body (e.g. Figure 4C). Vent tube dextral, mostly
unattached to fin behind and opens diagonally down to edge of ventral fin.

Nature Reserve, Western Australia. D = L. aurifera stage 37 dorsal view, Prince Regent River Nature Reserve, Western
Australia. Bar represents 5 mm.</p>
      <p>Tail: Dorsal fin begins at base of body, arches slightly near midpoint and tapers gradually to narrowly
rounded tip. Ventral fin not arched, maintains similar depth along length. Muscle moderate to robust at base of
body, tapers to narrow point.</p>
      <p>Pigmentation in life (Figures 5, 6): Dorsum and sides of body black with scattered, large bright gold
blotches and fine gold flecks around these (less flecks in earlier stages). These blotches are individually
variable in shape and number, except for three very prominent rounded blotches on the snout, which were
present in all specimens observed and positioned in the middle of the snout and symmetrically on each side of
the head anterior to the eyes (Figure 5D). Laterally, there is usually an irregularly-shaped gold blotch below
and/or behind each eye, one or more along middle of body and above this, and another at base of body. In
some the lateral gold blotches merge to form a broad stripe (M. and R. Barrett, pers. comm.). Ventral surface
transparent down middle third where gut, heart and gills are visible, lateral one-third on each side of abdomen
covered with dense layer of melanophores breaking into melanophore stippling over gills and anterior to oral
disc (Figure 5E).</p>
      <p>Tail pigment bitonal or tritonal - translucent pale or deep yellow (guanophore pigment) anteriorly with or
without a few black and gold patches (iridophore pigment), and dense black posteriorly, often with a few
irregular ‘windows’ in the fins tinted with pale gold and/or deep red. Dorsal fin dusky grey near base of body.</p>
      <p>From about stages 39–40, the dorsum gradually becomes dark golden brown rather than black, the golden
dorsal blotches begin to fade and the rounded patches around the front of the head begin to shrink (Figure 6B).
By stage 42, the dorsum is dark brown with numerous smaller pale spots, most of which highlight small
tubercles (Figure 6C). The lateral gold patch behind each eye transforms to a pale yellow patch over the upper
arm and a similar gold patch at the base of the body on each side becomes a pale beige patch on each thigh,
with another pale patch on each heel. Closer to metamorphosis at stage 46, the dorsal tubercles increase and
all pale gold dorsal blotches are gone.</p>
      <p>Pigmentation in preservative: After preservation, all pigment other than melanophores is lost. In ethanol,
whitish patches on body (indicative of gold patches in life in L. aurifera) are still visible, while in specimens
preserved in formalin, they are lost or much less visible.</p>
      <p>Oral Disc: Ventral, suctorial and almost as wide as snout, distinctly triangular in shape when not attached
to substrate. Entirely surrounded by numerous small papillae, with 1–2 rows anteriorly increasing to 2–3
laterally and numerous rows at each posterior corner (Figure 7B); 2–3 rows posteriorly, marginal papillae
mostly more pointed and longer. Two anterior and three posterior tooth rows with fine teeth crowded into a
medial pleat in all but A2 row; narrow medial gap in A2, P1,2,3 entire. All tooth rows very long and extend to
papillae; anterior rows longer than posterior rows and A1 extends around inside edge of most of disc. Jaw
sheaths slender, upper sheath broad and very slightly arched with a slight shallow medial indent on the lower
edge; lower sheath distinctly V-shaped. Labial tooth row formula: 2(2)/3.</p>
      <p>Behaviour. Tadpoles are benthic and mostly remain stationary on rocks on the floor of the stream where
their contrasting pigment patterns may provide greater camouflage by breaking up the outline of the body
when viewed from above on the substrate of patchy dark algae and yellow sandstone (Figures 6E, F). They
also adhere to vertical rock faces above the substrate (M. and R. Barrett, pers. comm.). Tadpoles are difficult
to dislodge when adhering to rock with the oral disc, and when disturbed, they dart across the bottom in fast
sudden spurts, changing direction abruptly.</p>
      <p>Samples maintained in captivity behaved in a similar manner and at times adhered vertically to the sides
of the container, frequently within the current of water flow created by the pump and airstone, where they
could maintain strong suction. They were observed to feed on silt and small amounts of finely crushed algae
disc on the substrate and also algae on rocks.</p>
      <p>Metamorphosis: Development to metamorphosis is rapid once tadpoles have reached stage 39. Newly
metamorphosed froglets were dark brown with numerous paler raised tubercles over the dorsum and dull
darker bands across hind limbs and lower arms (Figure 6D). Iris golden, tympanum not yet visible. Snout
pointed; dark brown vertical bars alternate with silvery white along upper lip. Cream patches on upper arm,
near each knee and across base of tibia. Ventral surface whitish-grey. Finger and toe discs as yet very small;
webbing between toes as for adult. Four metamorphs at stage 46 had a mean SVL of 9.3 mm (8.5–10 mm).

      <title>Call analysis</title>
      <p>In the recordings of L. aurifera we could distinguish three distinct call types: 'advertisement', 'squeak' and
'grind'. Males in a chorus typically produced squeaks, then grinds that led into a bout of advertisement calls,
although we sometimes initially recorded a bout of advertisement calls that were followed by squeaks and
grinds. For all five males we only analysed one significant bout of advertisement calls because frogs were
calling intermittently and were easily disturbed.</p>
      <p>For L. meiriana we recognised two call types: advertisement and squeak. Squeak calls occurred between
bouts of advertisement calling, but in the terminal stages of advertisement call bouts (the last three to five
calls) a squeak was sometimes added to the end of a standard advertisement call. Squeak calls were often
preceded by a very short, low intensity pulse train comprising 1–8 pulses. On rare occasions this pulse train
was extended and the intensity of the opening pulse train was raised, making them sound more like
advertisement calls with a following squeak, or like the grind call in L. aurifera.</p>
      <p>We analysed then averaged data from three advertisement calls per male (middle of a call bout for L.
aurifera and beginning, middle and end of a call bout for L. meiriana). We report detailed analyses of
advertisement calls only, but report the rate of production of squeaks and grinds in the total call sequence
recorded.</p>
      <p>The advertisement call of L. aurifera is a short pulse train (0.15 sec duration), 40 pulses per call at 276
pulses per second (at 27.8˚C). The call has two frequency components – the low frequency components rise
from 2300 to 2700 Hz and the high frequency from 4000 to 5000 Hz across the call duration. Males call in
bouts which are separated by randomly emitted ‘squeak’ calls followed by a series of ‘grind’ calls before
bouts of advertisement calls. Squeaks have higher frequencies and three frequency bands, grind calls have
more pulses and lower pulse rates than advertisement calls (Figure 8).</p>
      <p>Comparisons of call parameters in L. aurifera and L. meiriana are given in Table 2 and calls and calling
sequences are illustrated in Figures 8 and 9. The calls of the two species differ in four major ways:
i) L. aurifera produces three call types: squeak, grind and advertisement; L. meiriana only produces squeaks
and advertisement calls (Figures 8, 9) with the proportion of advertisement calls much higher in L.
meiriana.
ii) Advertisement calls of L. aurifera have lower pulse rates but more pulses per call and consequently much
longer advertisement calls than L. meiriana.
iii) Calls of L. aurifera have two frequency peaks but those of L. meiriana have three.
iv) Calls of both species have a degree of frequency modulation across the call but this is more marked in L.
aurifera where the fundamental frequency rises by about 400 Hz across the call but only by 100 Hz in L.

      <title>Comparisons with other species</title>
      <p>As adults, Litoria aurifera can only be confused morphologically with L. meiriana. There is nothing unique
about this high degree of similarity as there are numerous anuran species that are morphologically very
similar and only easily distinguished by calls or DNA. More unusual here is the situation whereby the main
morphological distinction between L. aurifera and L. meiriana is most evident at the tadpole stage, when the
species are strikingly different.</p>
      <p>Adult morphology. The small size of adult Litoria aurifera (18–22 mm) overlaps with only three other
Australian hylid species: L. meiriana (16–21 mm), L. microbelos (14–20 mm; Cogger 1966; Tyler &amp; Knight
2009) and L. bicolor (males to 23 mm; Tyler &amp; Doughty 2009). Neither of the latter two is found in rocky
environments. Litoria bicolor is readily distinguished by its biphasic call and green dorsal colour. Litoria
microbelos is usually smaller than L. aurifera and has a much more slender body, more pointed snout, smooth
skin and less toe-webbing than L. aurifera.</p>
      <p>Table 1 presents key morphological measurements of L. aurifera and L. meiriana. Comparison of these
failed to reveal any conspicuous differences, and slight differences described here are not sufficient to reliably
distinguish the species. While SVL, TL and HW are slightly greater for L. aurifera, there are no other
differences in any of the variables measured. Moreover, the overall appearance of both taxa is extremely
similar. The shape of the snout of the preserved holotype of each species appears slightly different in dorsal
view, with L. aurifera having a slightly more elongate pointed snout than L. meiriana (Figure 1A, C), but this
character was more difficult to determine given the variable state of preserved specimens.</p>
      <p>Some slight differences in colour and skin texture were noted. In life at night, L. aurifera appear to have a
more uniform dorsal colour than L. meiriana, often infused with a reddish hue. More contrasting mottling
becomes more obvious during the day (Figure 2C, D). In preservative they are almost always lighter than L.
meiriana, and the pale tubercles along the flanks are usually more prominent on a darker background colour in
L. meiriana than in L. aurifera.

      <p>Tadpole morphology and behaviour. Tables 3 and 4 summarise key differences noted between the
tadpoles of L. aurifera and L. meiriana. Comparisons of tadpole morphology and behaviour between the two
showed the following differences in body proportions, pigmentation and features of the oral disc:
i) Differences in pigmentation include the black dorsal colour of L. aurifera with distinctive large gold
botches, and the predominantly brown or golden brown dorsum of L. meiriana without these large gold
blotches. The bitonal or tritonal tail of L. aurifera (black and gold infused with red in some populations)
differs markedly from that of L. meiriana (Figures 5, 6).
ii) The two species differ in features of the oral disc. Litoria aurifera has a more suctorial oral disc than L.
meiriana, having marginal papillae that completely surround the disc and more numerous submarginal
papillae (especially around the posterior corners), whereas L. meiriana has a medial gap in the anterior
papillae and submarginal papillae are not as numerous (Figure 7).
iii) The eyes are positioned very slightly further posteriorly from the tip of the snout in L. aurifera than in L.</p>
      <p>meiriana.
iv) The eyes are slightly further apart in L. aurifera.
v) The spiracle opens slightly further along the body in L. aurifera.</p>
      <p>Tadpoles of L. aurifera can be differentiated from tadpoles of all other Australian anurans by their unique
and striking pigmentation including the bitonal (or tritonal) tail and distinctive gold blotches on a black dorsal
background, which are not present in combination in any other Australian species (Anstis, unpublished). In
late stages (40-41) when dorsal colour changes to brown with faded or no gold blotches (apart from some
lateral ones), tadpoles can still be differentiated from those of L. meiriana by the continuous anterior marginal
papillae. They can be distinguished from other sympatric saxicoline species including Crinia fimbriata,
Litoria cavernicola, L. coplandi, L. staccato, L. watjulumensis, Notaden weigeli and Limnodynastes lignarius
(Davies et al. 1994; Tyler et al. 1983; Anstis unpublished) by a combination of their smaller body size,
dramatic pigmentation, stream-dwelling adaptations including body and tail shape and the suctorial oral disc.

      <p>Call structure. The advertisement calls of L. aurifera and L. meiriana are broadly similar but there are
also some fundamental differences, particularly in number of pulses per call, pulse rate and consequently call
duration (Table 2). Given the two species are allopatric there is no reason to expect more significant call
differences, and the differences observed may be due to temperature differences (higher in L. meiriana, Table
2), to interaction with locally sympatric frog species or adaptations to generate effective sound transmission in
local habitat types. Although characterised here as differences between species, we need to be cautious about
their significance as the differences are comparable to variation reported within other hylid species from
northern Australia (Davies et al. 1983). For example, differences between pulse rates in calls of L. meiriana
and L. aurifera (23.8%) are comparable to pulse rate variation in L. pallida (28%) across sites separated by
approximately 1200 km and there is a 25% rise in pulse rate associated with a 0.4˚C rise in temperature
between sites in L. inermis. Differences in pulse number between L. meiriana and the new taxon are high
(40.3 vs 25.2), but no greater than variation in pulse number reported between sites for some species reported
by Davies et al. (1983; e.g. long calls L. inermis 17.7–39.7, L. pallida 63.5-81.3, L. tornieri, 23.8–35).</p>
      <p>Comparisons of calls between L. aurifera and L. meiriana would benefit from critical analyses of
homology of call types, impacts of chorus density and temperature on calling patterns and structure, and they
reiterate the observations by Davies et al. (1983) that northern Australian hylid frogs have complex but not
uninterpretable calling patterns that deserve more careful analysis.</p>

      <title>Comments</title>
      <p>Litoria aurifera is the fourth new frog species recently discovered and described from the Kimberley region.
The existence of undiscovered species, especially in the rugged high rainfall area of the north-west, may
reflect the impact of isolation by historically intermittent biogeographic barriers (cf. Bowman et al. 2010) and
the difficulty of exploring such terrain, especially in the wet season.</p>
      <p>Although our preliminary field studies were not comprehensive in terms of area covered, our observations
combined with those of M. and R. Barrett suggest that L. aurifera tadpoles appear to have a more patchy
‘niche’ distribution and are only known to occur in some first order creeks and not in larger streams within the
north-west Kimberley. This implies that the tadpoles may have rather specialised habitat requirements. Such
specialisation could result in a potentially more vulnerable status for this species than for the many other more
geographically widespread frogs in this region, especially if this frog is not locally abundant (Williams et al.
2009).</p>

traces have been optimised to illustrate frequency bands and modulation and do not necessarily reflect analytical settings
reported in the text. Bar represents 0.1 seconds.</p>
      <p>Other escarpment-dwelling species found in the Prince Regent River area are also found in the essentially
similar Mitchell Plateau escarpment country (about 95–143 km north-east of the Prince Regent study area),
including Litoria meiriana, L. cavernicola, L. staccato, L. watjulumensis, L. coplandi, Limnodynastes
lignarius, Notaden weigeli, Crinia fimbriata and Uperoleia borealis. More field work and molecular genetic
studies will be necessary to determine whether Litoria aurifera occurs further north in similar habitats to that
described at the type locality in the Prince Regent River Nature Reserve. Currently L. aurifera seems to be
locally common and secure in the Nature Reserve, but any future impacts from increasing fires, mining
activities, livestock encroachment and other feral species will need to be addressed.</p>
