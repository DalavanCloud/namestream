    <preformat>PROC. BIOL. SOC. WASH. \n106(4), 1993, pp. 162-11 A \nA NEW THOMASOMYS (MAMMALIA: RODENTIA) \n FROM THE PERUVIAN ANDES \nAlfred L. Gardner and Monica Romo R. \nAbstract. ?We describe a new species, Thomasomys macrotis, from the east- \n em slope of the Andes of northcentral Peru (department of San Martin, Rio \n Abiseo National Park). This rodent is a large-bodied, big-eared, but relatively \n short-tailed thomasomyine inhabiting the wet montane forest near the upper \n Hmit of the continuous forest zone. It is the second large, previously-unde- \n scribed Thomasomys to be found in the park. \nResumen.?T&gt;QScnbivcios una nueva especie, Thomasomys macrotis, de la \n vertiente oriental de los andes al norte del Peru (departamento de San Martin, \n Parque Nacional Rio Abiseo). Este roedor thomasomino de cuerpo y orejas \n grandes, pero de cola relativamente corta, habita el bosque humedo montano \n cerca al Hmite superior de la zona de bosque continuo. Este es el segundo \n Thomasomys grande, anteriormente desconocido, encontrado en el Parque. \nThe Peruvian Association for the Con- \n servation of Nature (APECO) recently com- \n pleted a 4-year (1987-1990) biological in- \n ventory of the Rio Abiseo National Park, \n San Martin, Peru. A new giant thomaso- \n myine, Thomasomys apeco, was found dur- \n ing the first year and recently described by \n Leo &amp; Gardner (1993). A second species \n represented by one specimen, also collected \n during the first year and sympatric with T. \n apeco, is a large, big-eared, and relatively \n short-tailed Thomasomys unlike any thus \n far known. Subsequently, we found three \n additional specimens in the mammal col- \n lection of Louisiana State University Mu- \n seum of Zoology, Baton Rouge (LSUMZ), \n collected in 1981 from a nearby locality in \n the park. The Rio Abiseo National Park, \n centered at approximately 07?45'S, 77?1 5'W, \n covers 2745 square kilometers on the east- \n em (Amazonian) slope of the Andes and \n encompasses most of the Rio Abiseo wa- \n tershed, which drains into the Rio Huallaga \n (Leo &amp; Gardner 1993). The western bound- \n ary of the park lies along the border between \n the departments of La Libertad and San \n Martin. The elevational range is from near \n1000 to more than 4000 m and includes at \n least five habitat zones according to the \n Holdridge Life Zone classification (Tosi \n 1960). Young &amp; Leon (1988) suggest that \n two additional life zones (Tropical Montane \n Wet Forest and Tropical Lower Montane \n Wet Forest) be recognized in the park. Sur- \n veys during the first year of study were at \n higher elevations (from about 3000 to 3600 \n m) in Tropical Subalpine Pluvial Paramo \n and Tropical Montane Rain Forest (Paramo \n Pluvial Subalpino and Bosque Humedo \n Montano, respectively; Tosi 1960). The new \n thomasomyine we describe here was caught \n in tropical montane elfin forest habitat; it \n may be known as: \nThomasomys macrotis, new species \nHolotype. -Adult female, LSUMZ 27286, \n from Puerta del Monte, ca. 30 km NE [of] \n Los Alisos, ca. 3250 m [Parque Nacional \n Rio Abiseo], San Martin, Peru. Collected \n by Linda J. Barkley on 1 3 August 1981. The \n holotype is a well-made skin in excellent \n condition with cranium, dentaries, and par- \n tial post-cranial skeleton that includes a \n</preformat>

J. \n Barkley on 8 August and 15 August (re- \n spectively), 1981. Young adult female, \n USNM 567243, from Pampa del Cuy, 24 \n km NE of Pataz, 3380 m, Parque Nacional \n Rio Abiseo, San Martin, Pern, collected by \n A. L. Gardner on 11 August 1987. \nDistribution. ?Known only from elfin \n forest habitat in the Pampa del Cuy Valley. \nEtymology. ?The name refers to the un- \n usually large ears, the most obvious feature \n of the species when encountered in the field. \nDiagnosis. ? Thomasomys macrotis is a \n large-bodied, big-eared thomasomyine with \n a long hind foot and comparatively short \n (1.34 times head and body; n = 4), basally \n dark brown and distally white tail. It is in- \n termediate in size between the smaller-bod- \n ied, but longer-tailed T. aureus (Tomes, \n 1860) and the much larger T. apeco, both \n of which are sympatric (Table 1). Diagnostic \n features include broad, spatulate nasals that \n extend only barely beyond the anterior plane \n of incisors and terminate behind premax- \n illary-frontal sutures; postorbital constric- \n tion with rounded upper borders and lack- \n ing ridges (Fig. 2); jugal strongly developed; \n tooth-bearing portion of maxilla unusually \n deep above M 1 and tapering posteriorly to \n root zone of M3 where maxilla is dorso- \n ventrally thin (Fig. 3); auditory bullae me- \n dium-sized to large with posterior and up- \n per anterior border of auditory meatus \n unusually inflated (Fig. 4); zygomatic plate \n terminating on a line behind procingulum \n of first upper molar (Ml); procingulum of \n Ml with smooth anterior face; anterome- \n dial flexid of first lower molar (m 1 ) shallow \n and narrow (dental terminology follows Reig \n 1977; also see Carleton &amp; Musser 1989); \n cusps on all teeth robust and separated by \n relatively narrow flexi and flexids; oblique \n orientation of paralophs, metalophs, and \n5k \nFig. 1 .

Digit II slightly \n shorter than subequal digits III and IV. Claw \n tip of digit V extends to approximately mid- \n length of second phalanx of digit IV (Fig. \n1). \nSkull, although large and robust, typically \n thomasomyine (sensu Steadman &amp; Ray \n 1982:15) in dental topography, length of \n hard palate, lack of overhanging postorbital \n ridges (Fig. 2), and presence of strut from \n mastoid extending anteriorly above and \n across ectotympanic to overlap squamosal \n in front of hamular process of squamosal \n (Fig. 4). Rostrum comparatively broad and \n deep, and with tapering, anteriorly-truncat- \n ed and spatulate nasals whose tips protrude \n only slightly beyond anterior plane of upper \n incisors. Dorsal branches of premaxillae \n short, not reaching distal ends of nasals and \n terminating at or anterior to level of zygo- \n matic notch (Figs. 2, 6). Zygomatic plate \n broad, its posterior margin terminating at \n approximate level of protoflexus of Ml, but \n its anterior border not occluding openings \n to nasolacrimal capsule when viewed lat- \n erally. Jugal large, its greatest depth ap- \n proximately equal to or greater than dis- \n tance between maxillary and squamosal \nportions of zygomatic arch (Fig. 7). Supra- \n orbital region elevated laterally with round- \n ed, non-overhanging borders and a shallow \n median depression extending from near an- \n terior border of interparietal to anterior third \n of nasals. Dorsal exposure of lacrimals com- \n paratively broad, each with a posterior me- \n dian projection. Alisphenoid strut present, \n but weak (incomplete on left in holotype). \n Auditory bullae medium-sized to large for \n genus. Upper border of incomplete ecto- \n tympanic ring forming auditory meatus (be- \n low second [posterior] dorsal postglenoid \n fossa) notably swollen and its terminus blunt \n (Fig. 4). Ventral surface of periotic broadly \n exposed. Mastoid fenestra small. Squamo- \n sal-alisphenoid groove (for supraorbital \n branch of stapedial artery) and sphenofron- \n tal foramen absent; stapedial foramen small. \n Mesopterygoid fossa of uniform width, not \n expanded anteriorly; its width equal to or \n less than width of either parapterygoid fossa \n (Fig. 2). \nMolar-bearing portion of maxilla unusu- \n ally deep at level of M 1 and tapering pos- \n teriorly to level of M3 where the bone is \n dorsoventrally comparatively thin (Fig. 3 a). \n Roots of M3 and posterior roots of M2 ex- \n tend through maxilla into orbital fossa. \nUpper incisors slightly procumbent, \n without grooves; upper and lower molars \n large and robust; all except M3 longer than \n wide and forming a graded series (Fig. 5 a, \n b). M3 is wider than long. Procingulum of \n Ml lacks any trace of anterior cuspules, \n styles, or cingular ridge.

Although av- \n eraging larger (see Table 1), T. macrotis is \n most similar in size to T. aureus from which \n it can be distinguished externally by darker \n brown and softer fur dorsally and ventrally, \n significantly longer (no overlap in measure- \n ments) ears and hind feet, and bicolored \n relatively- shorter tail (averages 1.34 times \n length of head and body versus 1.43 times \n [? = 14] head and body in T. aureus). Thom- \n asomys aureus has reddish fur, a distinctly \n ochraceous venter, and a longer and mono- \n colored tail. Cranially, T. macrotis can be \n readily distinguished from T. aureus by \n wider nasals that terminate distinctly be- \n hind premaxillae (compare in Fig. 6), \n broader postorbital constriction with more \n rounded borders, larger and deeper jugal \n (Fig. 7), conspicuously deeper maxilla above \n Ml than above M3 (Fig. 3), smooth anterior \n face of procingulum of Ml, M3 wider than \n long, shallow anteromedial flexid and \n straight posterolophid on ml, and entolo- \n phid of m2 joining median murid at right \n angle to axis of tooth (Fig. 5). In contrast, \n T. aureus has narrower nasals that extend \n forward of anterior face of incisors and ter- \n minate posteriorly at the same level as pre- \n maxillae (Fig. 6), narrower postorbital con- \n striction with sharper and more elevated \n borders, narrower jugal (Fig. lb), maxilla \n only little deeper above Ml than above M3 \n (Fig. 3^), conspicuous anterior cingular ridge \n with accessory cuspules and styles on pro- \n cingulum of Ml, M3 longer than wide (Fig. \n 5g), deep anteromedial flexid and crescent- \n shaped posterolophid on ml, and entolo- \n phid of m2 joining mesolophid more or less \n in line with axis of tooth (Fig. 5h). In mea- \n surements, T. macrotis averages larger than \nT. aureus in most dimensions. In the sam- \n ples at hand, there is no overlap in length \n of ear, hind foot, and maxillary toothrow, \n or in breadth across molars, and mastoidal \n and postorbital breadth, even when young \n adults of the former are included (see Table \n1). \nThere is little external, cranial, or dental \n similarity between T. macrotis and T. ape- \n co, except that both have a thick jugal and \n terminally white tail. Thomasomys apeco is \n significantly larger with no overlap in most \n dimensions (compare measurements in Ta- \n ble 1) and has coarser, reddish pelage with \n conspicuous guard hair. Cranially and den- \n tally, T. apeco shares more features with the \n smaller T. aureus than it does with T. mac- \n rotis and appears to be an outsized member \n of the T. aureus complex. Other than size, \n T. macrotis differs from T. apeco in many \n of the same ways that it differs from T. au- \n reus. Despite its overall smaller size, T. \n macrotis is larger than T. apeco in length of \n ear and breadth of postorbital constriction \n (Table 1). Thomasomys macrotis shares \n some dental features with the much larger, \n extinct Megaoryzomys curioi (Niethammer, \n 1964) known only from the Islas Galapagos \n of Ecuador (Steadman &amp; Ray 1982). These \n features include smooth anterior face of \n procingulum of Ml, weakly developed an- \n teromedial flexid in m 1 (retained only as an \n internal enamel island in M. curioi), and \n more medial orientation of paralophs, \n metalophs, metalophids and entolophids. \n Nevertheless, on the basis of dental and cra- \n nial features, T. macrotis is more closely \n related to T. ischyurus Osgood, 1914, and \n related Thomasomys, than with M. curioi \n or members of the T. aureus complex. \nRemarks.? Wq refer to specimens iden- \n tified as T aureus as the T. aureus complex \n in the text and Table 1 because we recognize \n that the name is used currently for three or \n more morphologically similar species. A \n thorough review and examination of the \n group is required before the number of spe- \n cies and their relationships can be estab- \n</preformat>
    <preformat>VOLUME 106, NUMBER 4 \n773 \nlished. Thomasomys macrotis is the second \n to be described of at least seven new mam- \n mals discovered during the Rio Abiseo fau- \n nal inventory. It is remarkable that the fau- \n na of this region contains such a high number \n of new taxa, and unfortunate that most of \n them are represented by single specimens. \nLabel information for LSUMZ 27285, a \n female collected 8 Aug 1981, includes the \n notation that she was nonparus with a vagi- \n nal plug. Corresponding information for two \n males is as follows: LSUMZ 27286, 13 Aug \n 1981, testes = 9.0 mm, abdominal; LSUMZ \n 27287, 15 Aug 1981, testes = 17.0 mm, \n scrotal. USNM 567243, a female, showed \n no overt evidence of reproductive activity \n when collected on 11 Aug 1987. \nAdditional specimens examined.? Oxh^r \n specimens we examined are deposited ei- \n ther in the collections of the Museo de His- \n toria Natural, Universidad Nacional Mayor \n de San Marcos, Lima, Peru (MUSM); the \n National Museum of Natural History, \n Washington, D.C., U.S.A. (USNM [Divi- \n sion of Mammals], USNM-P [Paleobiolo- \n gy]); or are indicated by field numbers (MLL \n [Mariella Leo L.] and MRR [Monica Romo \n R.]). The majority of the latter will be de- \n posited in the MUSM, which previously was \n commonly referred to in the literature as \n the Museo de Historia Natural "Javier Pra- \n do."
