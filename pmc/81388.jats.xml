    <preformat>VOLUME 115, NUMBER 3 \n489 \nIn April and May 1985, an exploratory \n survey of small mammals in the northern \n part of the State of Mexico uncovered sev- \n eral kinds of rodents that inhabited montane \n forest near the town of Jilotepec. Among \n the species samples collected in a cool, \n moist ravine were several specimens of a \n small-bodied mouse with a relatively short, \n hairy tail and large pinnae. Subsequent mu- \n seum study has convinced us that this dis- \n tinctive species represents an unnamed \n form of the genus Habromys (sensu Carle- \n ton 1989) that we name and describe here- \n in. The necessity of performing critical \n comparisons to other Habromys afforded us \n the opportunity to systematically review the \n genus and to amplify the geographic distri- \n bution of named forms based on unreported \n material. Finally, the humid forest, montane \n habitus of the genus encouraged compari- \n son of distributional patterns among other \n species of small terrestrial mammals in Me- \n soamerica. \nMaterials and Methods \nSpecimens reported herein consist prin- \n cipally of skins with their associated skulls \n and are contained in the following muse- \n ums and institutions: American Museum of \n Natural History, New York City (AMNH); \n Monte L. Bean Life Science Museum, \n Brigham Young University, Provo (BYU); \n Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago \n (FMNH); Collecion Nacional de Mamifer- \n os, Instituto de Biologia, Universidad Na- \n cional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City \n (CNMA); Museum of Natural History, Uni- \n versity of Kansas, Lawrence (KU); Muse- \n um of Vertebrate Zoology, University of \n California, Berkeley (MVZ); Museum of \n Zoology, University of Michigan, Ann Ar- \n bor (UMMZ); National Museum of Natural \n History, Smithsonian Institution, Washing- \n ton, D.C.

These measurements. \nand their abbreviations as used in text and \n tables, include: occipitonasal length (ONL); \n greatest zygomatic breadth (ZB); breadth of \n braincase (BBC); height of braincase \n (HBC); breadth across the occipital con- \n dyles (BOC); least interorbital breadth \n (lOB); length of rostrum (LR); breadth of \n rostrum (BR); postpalatal length (PPL); \n length of the bony palate (LBP); length of \n the upper diastema (LD); length of left in-</preformat>

Rostrum comparatively \n short for the genus (LR about 32% of \n ONL), narrow and attenuate toward the na- \n sal tips; tips of nasals slightly upturned; na- \n solacrimal capsules not appreciably flared. \n Interorbital region hourglass-shaped (am- \n phoral) as viewed dorsally, devoid of su- \n praorbital ridges or projecting shelves. Zy- \n goma extremely slender, particularly across \n the jugal bones, and slightly convergent an- \n teriorly as viewed from above. Zygomatic \n notch barely evident, no formation of an- \n teriorly projecting spine; leading margin of \n zygomatic plate straight and nearly vertical. \n Braincase globoid, smoothly rounded and \n unmarked by temporal and lambdoidal \n ridging. Interparietal relatively short and \n narrow, its lateral edges separated from the \n squamosal by broad contact of the exoccip- \n ital and frontal. Dorsal profile of skull mod- \n erately vaulted, nearly straight over the fa- \n cial region and more conspicuously arched \n over the calvarium. \nIncisive foramina relatively long (LIF \nabout 80% of LD), slightly narrower and \n convergent anteriorly but wider and paral- \n lel-sided posteriorly, their rear border pro- \n jecting between the anterior root of the Mis \n and reaching to the level of the anterocone. \n Bony palate nearly flat, pierced by a pair of \n small posterior palatine foramina, which are \n round to oval and open within the maxil- \n lopalatine suture where Ml and M2 abut. \n Forward margin of mesopterygoid fossa \n terminates more or less even with the rear \n edge of the M3s; shape of anterior portion \n horseshoe-like, slightly convergent in the \n posterior region; roof of mesopterygoid fos- \n sa incomplete, interrupted with spacious \n sphenopalatine vacuities. Parapterygoid \n fossae typically with large medial fenestra. \n Middle lacerate foramen slitlike, separated \n from the postglenoid foramen by stout \n overlap of the tegmen tympani and poster- \n oventral tab of the squamosal. Postglenoid \n and subsquamosal foramina medium-sized, \n approximately equal in area and together \n delineating a slender hamular process. Ca- \n rotid circulatory pattern complete (stapedial \n and sphenofrontal foramina present, poste- \n rior opening of the alisphenoid canal large, \n shallow groove crosses the inner surface of \n the squamosal and alisphenoid bones). Ali- \n sphenoid struts present on both sides of all \n individuals composing the type series. Ec- \n totympanic bullae relatively inflated, nearly \n the size of those possessed by the larger- \n bodied H. simulatus; large fenestra perfo- \n rates the posterodorsal surface of the mas- \n toid bullae. \nCoronoid process of mandible short, \n somewhat blunt, and not rising above level \n of condyloid process; sigmoid notch cor- \n respondingly shallow, noticeably less well \n defined than concavity of the angular notch. \n Lateral surface of ascending ramus smooth, \n without formation of capsular process of in- \n cisor; inferior and superior masseteric ridg- \n es poorly defined, their anterior union oc- \n curring below the middle of ml. \nUpper incisors weakly opisthodont to \n nearly orthodont; enamel faces of upper and \n lower incisors colored pale yellow.

The samples from Chiapas, Mex- \n ico (OTUs 7, 8), consistently cluster apart \n from those collected farther south in the \n mountains of Guatemala and El Salvador \n (Fig. 8). This phenetic association supports \n the observations of Robertson &amp; Musser \n (1976), who noted that the Chiapan exam- \n ples of//, lophurus average slightly smaller \n in most dimensions. Although probably iso- \n lated from populations in the nearest Gua- \ntemalan Cordilleras, we regard this slight \n distinction as intraspecific (geographic) var- \n iation and insufficient to warrant formal \n taxonomic recognition. \nThe case for the specific validity of chin- \n anteco is admittedly weak. Its range in \n northern Oaxaca appears to be limited to \n cloud forest on the Caribbean watershed of \n the Sierra de Juarez; to date, the form has \n not been recovered at sites situated on in- \n terior slopes of that sierra, places in pine- \n oak forest where H. ixtlani has been col- \n lected (Musser 1969). The geographic pres- \n ence of chinanteco in the Oaxacan high- \n lands thus mirrors the distribution of H. \n simulatus in subtropical cloud forest along \n the eastern slopes of the Sierra Madre Ori- \n ental (Fig. 12). The few examples of chin- \n anteco display appreciable morphological \n overlap with the few available of H. simu- \n latus, and most traits advanced for its di- \n agnosis fail to provide clear discrimination \n between the two taxa. Nevertheless, the \n characteristic of a relatively and absolutely \n longer tail in chinanteco, a cardinal feature \n of its diagnosis and separation from H. si- \n mulatus, cannot be controverted with the \n material at hand. In addition to appeal to \n other data such as molecular and chromo- \n somal information, the distinctive phallic \n traits reported above for H. simulatus prom- \n ise a firmer basis for deciding their synon- \n ymy if these are found also to characterize \n specimens of chinanteco. The status of \n chinanteco as species or junior synonym of \n //. simulatus should be argued on incontro- \n vertible evidence. In view of the meager \n numbers available and the different moun- \n tain systems these taxa occupy, we adopt a \n conservative course and shall leave the mat- \n ter to future systematic investigation. \nThe recognition of H. simulatus as spe- \n cies is secure, aside from the unresolved is- \n sue of whether it should subsume the pop- \n ulations described as chinanteco. However, \n vouchered documentation of its geographic \n range requires amplification, especially in \n light of the report by Leon-Paniagua &amp; \n Romo- Vazquez (1993) of Peromyscus aff. \n</preformat>
    <preformat>VOLUME 115, NUMBER 3 \n509 \nsimulatus in the Sierra de Taxco, Guerrero, \n a southern spur of the Cordillera Neovol- \n canica. \nHabromys is currently viewed as a genus \n closely allied to Podomys and Neotomodon, \n and more distantly related to Peromyscus \n proper (Carleton 1980, 1989). A similar \n phyletic affinity among the first three taxa \n is supported by other systematic evidence, \n although its cladistic stature with regard to \n species of Peromyscus and consequent suf- \n ficiency to warrant generic recognition are \n disputed (e.g., Stangl &amp; Baker 1984). \n Carleton (1980:127, 1989:128) has empha- \n sized the need for expanded anatomical sur- \n veys and critical reinterpretation of char- \n acter homologies for certain of the character \n systems applied telatively recently to ques- \n tions of muroid systematics and phylogeny, \n particularly those of the reproductive sys- \n tem. Habromys appears to be an excellent \n candidate for such investigation, the results \n of which would do much to clarify the \n monophyly of included species relative to \n Peromyscus and other genus-group kin. The \n structure of the phallus and complement of \n accessory glands reported here for the \n smaller species H. delicatulus and H. si- \n mulatus reveal greater variability in the piv- \n otal reproductive features on which the sub- \n genus was founded (Hooper &amp; Musser \n 1964) and upon which its phylogenetic di- \n agnosis and generic status were argued \n (Carleton 1980, 1989). Or perhaps this var- \n iation raises doubts only about the proper \n assignment of Osgood's (1904) simulatus to \n the genus-group taxon. Whichever the case, \n improved characterization of the reproduc- \n tive tract morphology of the small species \n assigned to Habromys must draw upon \n more and better preserved specimens. \nApart from the disagreement over details \n of cladistic branching and taxonomic rank, \n the above mentioned phylogenetic studies \n have improved little upon Hooper's (1968: \n 65) impression that "They [species of Ha- \n bromys] appear to be relict taxa, which \n jointly may date to an early stage in the \n evolution of the genus" (or tribe sensu \nCarleton 1989). As presently understood, \n the taxon includes some of the less well \n known, systematically and biologically, \n small Neotropical rodents. Only H. ixtlani \n is represented in collections in series suffi- \n cient to appreciate nongeographic variation. \n The inadequately small samples of H. si- \n mulatus and H. chinanteco clearly hinder \n decisive interpretation of their status as one \n or two species. \nPhyletic Diversification Within Habromys \n And Other Mesoamerican Small Mammals \nThe geographic occurrence of Habromys \n is disjunct, conforming to naturally discon- \n tinuous highland forests from southern \n Mexico, through Guatemala, to El Salvador \n and probably Honduras (Figs. 11, 12). Col- \n lectively, species of Habromys have been \n captured at sites ranging from 1830 to 3150 \n meters in altitude, and descriptions of col- \n lection sites consistently emphasize the \n cool, moist character of the forest, usually \n with a lush herbaceous ground cover, dense \n carpets of mosses and lichens, and abundant \n bromeliads and other epiphytes (Goldman \n 1951, Musser 1969, Carleton &amp; Huckaby \n 1975, Robertson &amp; Musser 1976). In Oa- \n xaca, collecting localities of Habromys fall \n within Cloud Forest (1250-2012 m) and \n Pine-Oak Forest (2012-3000 m), as those \n life zones are regarded by Binford (1989) \n for the state's avifauna. The type locality of \n the newly named H. delicatulus also fits \n this pattern, restricted to a cool forested en- \n clave on a north-facing slope of mountains \n fringing the southern Mesa Central. And \n Leon-Paniagua &amp; Romo- Vazquez (1993) \n reported Peromyscus aff. simulatus from \n the vicinity of Taxco, Guerrero, about \n 2200-2400 m in a steep ravine sheltered by \n oak forest. The latter two discoveries high- \n light the likelihood of greater taxonomic \n differentiation among such montane rodents \n than presently recognized, and invite not \n only additional biological survey of south- \n ern Mexico's geologically and biotically in- \n tricate mountains but also renewed revi- \n</preformat>

Habromys \n simulatus and H. chinanteco occupy moist forests along Gulf-facing slopes of Mexico's eastern versant, the \n former in the Sierra Madre Oriental to the north of the Rio Santo Domingo, and the latter in the Sierra de Juarez \n to the south. Stippled areas indicate regions above 2000 meters. \ntheir hierarchical levels of morphometric \n divergence and by analogy with biogeo- \n graphic patterns recently advanced for other \n small mammals confined to cool and moist \n highland forest in Mesoamerica (Sullivan et \n al. 1997, 2000; Woodman &amp; Timm 1999). \n Woodman &amp; Timm (1999:30) remarked \n that "In general, the isthmus [of Tehuante- \n pec] does not appear to have been regarded \n as a major barrier to most small mammals \n . . . ." Their point is not strictly true, as the \n following examples demonstrate, but holds \n import in a refocussed context.

On a continental scale, Wilson (1974) \n noted the strong association between high \n species density and high topographic relief, \n and his isocontours of greatest species den- \n sity in northern Mesoamerica are localized \n over the highlands on either side of the Isth- \n mus of Tehuantepec (although the isthmus \n</preformat>

Both \n Hooper (1952) and Choate (1970) did spe- \n cifically implicate the Isthmus of Tehuan- \n tepec as a primary fission zone in the ear- \n liest radiation of Reithrodontomys and \n Cryptotis, respectively, perhaps accounting \n for the initial evolutionary split between the \n subgenera Reithrodontomys and Aporodon \n on the one hand and for driving speciation \n within the Cryptotis mexicana species \n group on the other. And Hooper (1952:79) \n was well aware that "The low country of \n the Isthmus of Tehuantepec is a partial, if \n not complete, barrier to these highland forms \n [subspecies of Reithrodontomys sumichras- \n r/]," and that (p. 170) ''R[eithrodontomys] \n m[icrodon] albilabris is isolated from R. m. \n microdon by the Isthmus of Tehuantepec \n and by other arid lowlands." These exam- \n ples convey appreciable regard for the Isth- \n mus as a distributional divide, but, in gen- \n eral, those systematists of the middle 1900s \n who offered historical zoogeographic re- \n constructions preferentially emphasized its \n barrier effect in their divisions of subspe- \n cies (also see next section). \nAlthough not disregarded by mammalo- \n gists, consideration of the Isthmus in taxo- \n nomic studies of small montane mammals \n does appear understated compared with the \n preeminent biogeographic role attributed to \n those dry lowlands in other vertebrate \n groups (Duellman 1960, 1966; Savage \n 1982; Wake 1987; Good 1988; Binford \n 1989; Flores-Villela 1993; Campbell 1999; \n Watson &amp; Peterson 1999). Binford (1989) \n repeatedly emphasized the geographic im- \n passability interposed by the lowland trop- \n ical forests and drier climate of the Isthmus \n for the dispersal of bird species restricted to \n cloud forest and pine-oak habitats and the \n consequent high levels of endemism on ei- \n ther side of it. Good (1988) considered the \n vicariant significance of the Isthmus in in- \n terpreting the radiation of certain highland \n genera of gerrhonotine lizards with species \n clades distributed on either side of it. Flo- \n res-Villela (1993) regarded the Isthmus bar- \n rier and rich endemism of pine-oak and \ncloud forest herps in mountains to the west \n and east as logically interrelated. \nIn the context of such Mesoamerican bio- \n geographic investigation. Woodman &amp; \n Timm's (1999) observation exposes the rare \n cladistic documentation of related mam- \n malian species pairs in mountains bordering \n the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and the explicit \n invocation of the drier isthmian lowlands as \n the vicariant barrier impelling their initial \n geographic separation and eventual specia- \n tion. In a phylogenetic study of small-eared \n shrews, genus Cryptotis, they provided such \n cladistic evidence for the relationship of C \n goldmani and the species pair C goodwini- \n C griseoventris and postulated their evo- \n lutionary divergence coincident with the \n isthmian lowlands. Other possible vicariant \n pairs among small, montane dwelling ro- \n dents distributed over the same region in- \n clude Oryzomys chapmani-O. saturatior \n (Musser &amp; Carleton 1993) and [Habromys \n lepturus-H. ixtlani]-H. lophurus (this \n study). The most persuasive evidence for \n the interplay of Mesoamerican topography \n and phyletic diversification among montane \n rodents issues from the recent studies of \n Sullivan et al. (1997, 2000), who applied \n cytochrome b data to the understanding of \n phylogeographic relationships within the \n Peromyscus aztecus and Reithrodontomys \n sumichrasti complexes. In both cases, their \n trees divulged an early divergence of pop- \n ulations inhabiting highlands to the east of \n the Isthmus of Tehuantepec from those in \n highlands to the west and north. Although \n the differentiation of these trans-isthmian \n moieties is not recognized at the specific \n level in current taxonomy, the weight of \n their evidence inescapably points toward \n that conclusion. \nOf the 76 small terrestrial mammals and \n seven montainous regions considered here \n (Table 6), the greatest densities of species \n occur in the highlands that flank the Isth- \n mus of Tehuantepec, the Oaxacan High- \n lands and Nucleiir Central America. The \n latter region also contains a large percent- \n age of endemic species, over half according \n</preformat>

    <preformat>518 \nPROCEEDINGS OF THE BIOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON \nhave included the bordering Cordilleras of \n the Mexican Plateau only to the vicinity of \n the eastern reaches of the Cordillera Neo- \n volcanica, whereas the latter extend the bio- \n geographic province farther south to in- \n clude the Sierras de Juarez and Zempoal- \n tepec of northern Oaxaca. Ecological con- \n siderations, as much as or more than \n physiographic ones, may bear on these dif- \n fering interpretations of the limits of the Si- \n erra Madre Oriental as an area of ende- \n mism. For example, the Sierra Madre Ori- \n ental inclusive of humid montane forests, as \n identified here and in other studies, already \n conflates the notions of physiographic space \n and biotic community and introduces defi- \n nitional ambiguities (see Andersson 1996). \nFuture researchers will undoubtedly im- \n prove these area definitions, accepted here \n as (loosely) predefined, and correct atten- \n dant inconsistencies and assumptions as \n they apply to montane small mammals. The \n seven mountain regions are probably coarse \n biogeographic groupings that should be \n subdivided more in line with those identi- \n fied for the Mesoamerican avifauna, as a \n basis for initially mapping vouchered spe- \n cific occurrences and then discerning mean- \n ingful biogeographic units (Hernandez-Ba- \n rios et al. 1995). For many small mammals, \n however, the distributional baseline and tax- \n onomic framework do not match those \n available for Neotropical ornithology. Re- \n finement of area definitions thus requires \n much basic attention to the insufficiencies \n identified in the next two points. \n(2) Recognizing congruence in geograph- \n ic ranges and areas of endemism hinges \n foremost on the empirical foundation of \n species distributions. Levels of collecting \n effort and the field sampling methods em- \n ployed are implicitly assumed to be com- \n parable in deriving the species tallies used \n to compute faunal resemblances. For the \n small mammals in question, we know that \n such biological survey and vouchered doc- \n umentation within and among these high- \n lands are grossly uneven and incomplete. \n The omission of at least some naturally oc- \ncurring species from a given region is prob- \n able, and the status of rarely collected spe- \n cies as broadly or narrowly distributed \n within it is uncertain. Additional field in- \n ventory is the obvious prescription, empha- \n sizing elevational transects where continu- \n ous forest remains, together with intensive \n site surveys to document the resident mon- \n tane mammals. The recent investigations in \n northern Oaxaca by Briones-Salas et al. \n (2001) and Sanchez-Cordero (2001) offer \n model examples that could be profitably ex- \n tended to other mountain systems whose \n small mammals are poorly known. The in- \n sufficiencies to be redressed for the mam- \n malian fauna indigenous to Mesoamerican \n humid montane forests are essentially the \n same as those identified by Voss and Em- \n mons (1996:68-70) for Neotropical low- \n land rainforests. \n(3) In addition to basic field inventory, \n the need for concerted systematic review of \n many montane forms, particularly those \n that are widely distributed, is sorely mani- \n fest. Many are species composites (see next \n discussion), and future revisions will nec- \n essarily alter the present snapshot of species \n diversity, geographic occurrence, and levels \n of endemicity. Indeed, the dry environment \n of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and its in- \n hospitable nature for mesic-adapted organ- \n isms encourage the prediction that no spe- \n cies of small terrestrial mammal restricted \n to middle to upper montane humid forest \n has constituent populations distributed in \n mountains on both sides of it. This should \n be the operable null hypothesis requiring \n falsification as systematic revision of poly- \n typic, widely distributed forms in Mesoam- \n erica proceeds. The present tally of 76 spe- \n cies of shrews and small rodents thought to \n be restricted to Mesoamerican highland for- \n est probably underestimates the biodiversity \n of these families by 30%, perhaps as much \n as 40%. \n(4) Co-occunence measures of faunal \n similarity and parsimony analyses of ende- \n mism, while useful exploratory approaches \n to highlight possible areas of endemicity \n</preformat>

The phenetic hi- \n erarchy among the montane regions di- \n vulged by resemblance coefficients is \n heavily influenced by the number of en- \n demic species, counts of which speak little \n to their historical patterns of diversification. \n The structure of area relationships apparent \n from parsimony analyses of endemism \n stresses the coassociations of species pre- \n sumed to be monophyletic. Unfortunately, \n these are precisely the same widely ranging, \n polytypic forms whose composite nature is \n most suspect. Nor can we presume that the \n heterogeneous elements of these nominal \n constructs, when eventually demonstrated \n to be specifically distinct, themselves form \n a monophyletic clade. Choate's (1970) def- \n initions of Cryptotis goldmani and C. mex- \n icana have been shown to be paraphyletic \n or polyphyletic mosaics in subsequent cla- \n distic studies (Woodman &amp; Timm 1999, \n 2000). The species segregated from Pero- \n myscus boylii sensu Osgood (1909) or \n Hooper (1968) have proven to be members \n of at least two (Carleton 1989) or probably \n three (Tiemann-Boege et al. 2000) different \n species groups. \nWell-supported hypotheses of phyloge- \n netic relationship for multiple, co-occurring \n species provide a stronger basis for identi- \n fication of concordant patterns of area re- \n lationship, and this is the great advantage \n supplied by the studies of Sullivan et al. \n (1997, 2000) and Woodman &amp; Timm \n (1999). Many more small mammals distrib- \n uted over the same Mesoamerican mountain \n ranges deserve comparable phylogenetic in- \n vestigation and detailed systematic revision \n to assess the generality of the biogeograph- \n ic patterns that their studies reveal. \nEfforts to improve upon any one of these \n inadequacies, but especially points 2 and 3, \n will synergistically advance our under- \n standing of the others. \nSummary And Research Prospectus \nThe substantial genetic and morphologi- \n cal discontinuities now being uncovered \n within such broadly distributed species of \n Mesoamerican small mammals should sur- \n prise no one when the historical context of \n their definition is considered. Widespread \n ascension of the biological species concept, \n as taxonomically evidenced in the expanded \n usage of the trinomial, constrained the sys- \n tematist's interpretation of interpopulational \n variation and its habitual nomenclatural ex- \n pression, the subspecies. Operating under \n the guiding paradigm of the New System- \n atics, taxonomic revisions conducted \n throughout the early to middle 1900s \n served to accrete more or less distinctive \n forms as widely ranging, polytypic species, \n for example as neatly mapped in Hall \n (1981), and in doing so, superficially im- \n parted a well understood foundation of spe- \n cies systematics and geographic distribu- \n tions. With regard to biogeographic under- \n standing of Mesoamerican small mammals, \n such protean specific constructs, ranging \n over highlands from southern Mexico to \n western Panama, obscured or diminished \n appreciation of potential barriers such as the \n Isthmus of Tehuantepec and the Nicaraguan \n Depression whenever systematists pondered \n the distributional limits of Neotropical spe- \n cies. \nThe improved investigational tools (mor- \n phometry, karyology, electrophoresis, gene \n sequencing) and methodological advance- \n ments (cladistics, phylogenetic species, vi- \n cariant biogeography, phylogeography), as \n they began to enter the practice of system- \n atic mammalogy in the late 1900s, simply \n confer a more rigorous conceptual frame- \n work and improved analytic procedures to \n refine the systematic foundation handed \n down from the New Systematics era. Of \n relevance here, these fresh approaches to \n questions of species-level taxonomy pro- \n vide explicit and concrete evaluation of var- \n iation, most notably as they bear on the \n kinds of evidence marshalled by our sys- \n</preformat>
    <preformat>520 \nPROCEEDINGS OF THE BIOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON \ntematic predecessors to support population- \n al intergradation, a conclusion integral to \n adducing conspecificity. For them, the cri- \n terion of intergradation, whether actually \n demonstrated (seldom) or plausibly inferred \n (often), was practically applied in two \n ways. \nOne involved the expectation that mor- \n phological intermediacy would be found to \n characterize geographically intermediate \n populations between two otherwise distinc- \n tive forms, whether separated by great or \n small distances. Thus, Osgood (1909:123- \n 124), in justifying his subspecific arrange- \n ment of Peromyscus leucopus, reasoned \n that "If we suppose that leucopus, texanus, \n etc., have continuous distribution with grad- \n ual intergradation (and no doubt this is the \n case), we should expect to find specimens \n in central Oklahoma intermediate in char- \n acter between aridulus and texanus on the \n one hand and between leucopus and tex- \n anus on the other." Vouchered documen- \n tation of intergradation between these sub- \n species in Oklahoma was eventually con- \n firmed, although Osgood could hardly have \n foreseen the fertile evolutionary essays on \n step clines, hybrid tension zones, and ge- \n netic introgression that his pragmatic clas- \n sificatory outline would one day animate \n (Baker et al. 1983, Stangl &amp; Baker 1984a, \n Stangl 1986, Nelson et al. 1987). In his \n study of variation and subspeciation within \n Peromyscus truei, Hoffmeister (1951:48) \n did recognize an abrupt shift in certain mor- \n phological features around the U.S. -Mexi- \n can boundary, but supposed that "the zone \n of intergradation between truei and gentilis \n [now = P. gratus] is narrow." In this in- \n stance, finer regional sampling in southern \n New Mexico and recourse to discretely as- \n sortative traits such as chromosomal inver- \n sions and protein alleles have not sustained \n Hoffmeister's conclusion (Zimmermann et \n al. 1978, Modi &amp; Lee 1984, Janecek 1990); \n however, his treatment was certainly rea- \n sonable and understandable given the geo- \n graphic samples then at hand, existing uni- \n variate methods for analyzing variation, and \nperiod conventions for representing spe- \n cies-level taxonomic hypotheses. \nThe second evidentiary standard for in- \n tergradation involved the detection of mor- \n phological extremes within a homogeneous \n population, or geographically discrete set of \n populations, that purportedly overlapped or \n bridged the diagnostic traits cited for named \n geographic isolates. In arguing the synon- \n ymy of Reithrodontomys sumichrasti (in the \n highlands west of the Isthmus of Tehuan- \n tepec) and dorsalis (in highlands to the \n east). Hooper (1952:79) acknowledged that \n "it is improbable that their populations are \n continuous at the present time," yet "There \n is now ample evidence of intergradation, \n through individual variation, of dorsalis \n and sumichrasti; they can best be treated as \n conspecific." Whether viewed as a species \n (Howell 1914) or subspecies (Hooper \n 1952), each geographic grouping is strongly \n characterized morphologically, and as re- \n vealed by recent molecular research (Sulli- \n van et al. 2000), highly distinctive geneti- \n cally as well. In like manner, Musser (1969: \n 17) judged the two "morphologically dis- \n tinctive" but wholly "insular groups" of \n Habromys (lepturus and ixtlani) to "inter- \n grade through individual variation," a pre- \n diction not sustained by morphometric eval- \n uation of that variation. \nThe new information sources, analytical \n techniques, and methodological rigor that \n emerged in the late 1900s will supply crit- \n ical examination of either notion of inter- \n gradation, but they will prove crucially piv- \n otal in reappraising interpretations of the \n second kind, the "individual variation" \n once used to conclude the specific synon- \n ymy of more or less distinctive geographic \n isolates. Polytypic candidates for renewed \n revisionary attention abound among Me- \n soamerica's small terrestrial mammals dis- \n tributed in highland settings: Sorex saus- \n surei, S. veraepacis, Cryptotis mexicaua, \n and C parva\ Oryzomys chapmani; Pero- \n myscus aztecus and P. baetae: and Reith- \n rodontomys sumichrasti, R. fulvescens, R. \n nuwicanus, and R. microdon.
